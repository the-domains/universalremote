# UNIVERSAL REMOTE at All-Con 2016

We'll have four - FOUR - new episodes to roll out at [All-Con 2016][0], the four-day extravaganza of all things pop culture. Admission is free for All-Con badgeholders. You really, really should consider being one yourself. All contestants will win prizes, and the winner of each episode will walk away with gift cards to Keith's Comics, Red Pegasus, Order 66 Toys and more.

Here's the rundown:

Episode 1 (Friday 18 March - 3:00 pm): Our normal show (we'll have enough problems getting Devin there on time)

Episode 2 (Saturday 19 March - 1:00 pm): Battle of the Cosplay Stars - is Tony Stark actually smarter than Wonder Woman? Can Clark Kent answer questions that don't involve the word "Krypton"? \[Characters subject to change - we have no idea who will be there. Really. Honest.\]

Episode 3 (Saturday 19 March - 7:00 pm): Back To The Eighties - when you had to try and squint through a batch of static and scrambling to see the naughty bits on cable channels you didn't have. \[THIS EPISODE IS RATED M for imMature. Easily offended people will probably get offended. You're probably already offended. We'll recommend an early night for ya.\]

Episode 4 (Sunday 20 March - 10:00 am): Sunday Brunch episode - can someone please bring a pitcher of Bloody Marys?

In each episode (with the exception of Ep 2), we'll be pulling contestants from the audience, so be prepared to have fun with us, whether you're on stage or in the crowd heckling those on stage! See you at [All-Con Dallas][1]!
