# On The Air...

I've had a long-standing love affair with game shows. It started with shows like MATCH GAME, PASSWORD, JEOPARDY, and PRESS YOUR LUCK, then (obviously) WHEEL OF FORTUNE and WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE? However, one show resonated strongly with me, and that was MTV's REMOTE CONTROL.

The first non-music-video centered programming MTV ran, REMOTE CONTROL engulfed my world in 1989\. I wanted to be a contestant **badly**... but I also wanted to learn about the mechanics of it. Sure, it wasn't really filmed in a basement. I got that. However, there were pieces I really wanted to strip down and study its components. The questions were rapid-fire, the show's aesthetics were late-80s kitsch, and the writing was ambitious, even if it didn't fire on all cylinders.

There was also the host, Ken Ober. He had a very easy delivery, and always knew where the joke was -- a trait Ober shared with the great hosts like Martingale, Rayburn and Trebek.

A lot of people share that love of REMOTE CONTROL, and wanted to see its legacy revitalized for a new generation of game players. That's why we launched UNIVERSAL REMOTE.

While it possesses some of the DNA of its predecessor, UNIVERSAL REMOTE is a show that broadens its scope to all of pop culture: movies, TV, music and more. Likely because the hosts and writers are all nerds of a high order, you'll see a shift towards sci-fi and fantasy... but that's where pop culture is, these days.

When UNIVERSAL REMOTE is getting ready to air -- well, go live, anyway -- we'll post that information here. You can also find it on our [Facebook page][0], [Twitter account][1], and other digital carrier pigeons.

We look forward to annoying you very soon.
